EXTRA PARAMS FOR THE PROGRAM structure.  THESE PARAMETERS CONTROL HOW THE
PROGRAM RUNS.  ATTRIBUTES OF THE DATAFILE AS WELL AS K AND RUNLENGTH ARE 
SPECIFIED IN mainparams.

"(int)" means that this takes an integer value.
"(d)"   means that this is a double (ie, a Real number such as 3.14).
"(B)"   means that this variable is Boolean 
        (ie insert 1 for True, and 0 for False).

GENE MODEL TO USE = IN THIS CASE USE ADMIXTURE + CORRELATED ALLELE FREQUENCIES
#define NOADMIX     0 // (B) Use no admixture model (0=admixture model, 1=no-admix), same as Sharma et al., 2018
#define LINKAGE     0 // (B) Use the linkage model
#define USEPOPINFO  0 // (B) Use prior population information to pre-assign individuals to clusters
#define LOCPRIOR    0 //(B)  Use location information to improve weak data
#define FREQSCORR   1 // (B) assume allele frequencies are correlated among pops, same as Sharma et al., 2018
#define ONEFST      0 // (B) assume same value of Fst for all subpopulations, RECOMMEND SET TO O

ALPHA VALUE = HAVE INFERRED AT EACH MCMC REP TO CHECK CONVERGENCE AND ASSESS MODEL
#define INFERALPHA  1 // (B) Infer ALPHA (the admixture parameter)
#define POPALPHAS   0 // (B) Individual alpha for each population, not recommended in most cases
#define ALPHA     1.0 // (d) Dirichlet parameter for degree of admixture (this is the initial value if INFERALPHA==1).

LAMBDA VALUE = USING A FIXED VALUE OF 1 IS BEST IN MOST SITUATIONS, HENCE HAVENT INFERRED
#define LAMBDA    1.0 // (d) Dirichlet parameter for allele frequencies
#define INFERLAMBDA 0 // (B) Infer LAMBDA (the allele frequencies parameter), not recommended in most cases
#define POPSPECIFICLAMBDA 0 //(B) infer a separate lambda for each pop (only if INFERLAMBDA=1).

Note one can also paramatize the priors for the probability models. But as stated in the manual default
settings are fairly sensible in most cases so have not changed these here.

PRINT DESCRIPTIVE DATA
#define PRINTNET     1 // (B) Print the "net nucleotide distance" to screen during the run
#define PRINTLAMBDA  0 // (B) Print current value(s) of lambda to screen, not needed as set to 1 above
#define PRINTQSUM    1 // (B) Print summary of current population membership to screen

OUTPUT FILE OPTIONS
#define ECHODATA     1  // (B) Print some of data file to screen to check that the data entry is correct 
#define SITEBYSITE 0 // (B) Print a complete summary of assignment probabilities for every genotype in the data, off as produces very large files
#define PRINTQHAT 1 // (B) Print estimates to file with suffix q, required for other analysis (STRAT) if required later

COLLECT DISTRIBUTION DATA FOR Q
#define ANCESTDIST   1  // (B) collect data about the distribution of ancestry coefficients (Q) for each individual
#define NUMBOXES   1000 // (int) the distribution of Q values is stored as a histogram with this number of boxes. 
#define ANCESTPINT 1.0 // (d) the size of the displayed probability interval on Q (values between 0.0--1.0)

COMPUTE PROBABILITIES FOR K ESTIMATES
#define COMPUTEPROB 1 // (B) estimate the probability of the data given K and the model
